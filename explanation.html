		<section id="philosophy">
			<h2> STATELESSNESS AND RESPONSABILITY </h2>
      <p class="explanation">Stateless Vault is a password wallet that generates passwords locally.
				Key principles of Stateless Vault are statelessness and responsability. There's no real 
				encrypted vault, so there's no sign in or login and personal data, like your name or your 		
				passwords, are not sent or stored to any server.
				The name Stateless Vault is an <span class="bold" > oxymoron </span> because in real 
				life every kind of vault has a state. State is the technical term for "what needs to be saved".
				Your storage support or a cloud won't have an encrypted file and they won't manage encrypted
				communication over the internet. So vulnerable surface is reduced and risks upon state protection disappear.
				Breaking your hard drive, losing your device or breaching against your cloud provider will not affect
				your passwords.</p>
			<p class="explanation">But warning, user is totally responsible for management of his passwords. 
				In fact stateless operations imply that an algorithm can give you what you need based on nothing 
				more than input you can give. Input information are determinant to calculate always the same 
				expected generated passwords. <span class="bold" > Don't forget the following input information. </span>
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<!-- This section explains how it works. -->
		<section id="howItWorks">
			<h2>INPUT INFORMATION </h2>
      	<p class="explanation"> 
					  Stateless Vault requires three pieces of information that user must remember. 
					The following rules are recommended.
				</p>
				<!-- Full name, secret password and site name. Rules for a correct use -->
				<ol>
					<li> First information is <span class="bold" > your full name</span>, 
							 as it's written on your ID card or passport. This information could be exposed. 
							 The strength of the encryption is not based on it, but it's necessary for calculation.
					</li>
					<li> Second information is <span class="bold" >a unique, personal and secret password </span>. 
							 This information must be rembered without saving it or writing it anywhere. A good 
							 secret password could be a nonsense phrase. The strength of Stateless Vault generation 
							 process is based on it. Take your time for thinking a unique, easy to remember and strong secret password.
					</li> 
					<li> Third information is about <span class="bold"> where you need to be authenticated</span>. 
							 It could be the URI where you want to login, it could be site's name of the service, 
							 it could be the name of the service itself, it could be the name of a physical device. 
							 It's up to you. Our suggestion: choose a way for all your generated password and mantain 
							 it beacause you must remember it. 
					</li>
					<li> Optional fourth information: a<span class="bold"> numeric value </span> between 1 and 100. 
							 This number allows user to change generated password. Stateless Vault shows a counter 
							 to input this numeric value and the default value is 1. User should increase default value
							 when he wants to modify generated password only (for exemple, after a fixed period of time) 
							 without modifying his unique secret password. The site counter ensures you can easily create 
							 new password for the site if that password were compromised.
					</li>
				</ol>
			<p class="explanation"> 
			Thanks to these information you'll be always able to generate the same passwords because Stateless Vault 
			doesn't store any data about your name, your secret passwords or your sites. It's based on <span class="bold">
			mathematics</span>. An addition, for example 1 + 2 + 3, will always give the same result, in our example 6. 
			You can try it on every calculator and it will be 6 every time. At the same way, Stateless Vault uses input 
			information to calculate always the same generated passwords. Every working browser (except Internet Explorer, 
			Opera Mini and current version of Microsoft Edge) will produce your passwords.

		<!-- This section explains lightness and off-line use -->
		<section id="lightnessOffline">
			<h2> LIGHTNESS AND OFF-LINE USE </h2>
      	<p class="explanation"> 
					Stateless Vault uses your <span class="bold">Application Cache (AppCache) </span> to run its web 
					application offline. So Stateless Vault will be loaded and work correctly even if users click 
					the refresh button when they are offline. There are some advantages: offline passwords recovering, 
					speed and reduced server load. After your first connection to the web application, you'll be able to 
					calculate your generated passwords every time you want on the same browser regardless you are online or offline. <br>
					Stateless Vault is <span class="bold"> light </span> because there are no personal data to store. 
					In your Application Cache Stateless Vault will occupy no more than 300 KB. This is suitable even for 
					device with small storage capacity.
					</p>
				<p class="explanation">
						Moreover, you can also add this web application to your home screen, as a standalone web app. Discover 
						<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/">
						how to do it</a>. This is a easy way to access Stateless Vault directly from your smartphone or desktop without 
						opening your browser, but this is not a real app. In this case you won't be able to access Stateless Vault 
						offline. It's just a shortcut. Offline use works only on web browsers.
